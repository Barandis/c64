// A single tone oscillator/waveform generator used in the 6581 SID.
//
// The oscillator consists of a phase accumulator followed by logic to turn the output of
// that oscillator into a waveform of a particular shape.
//
// A phase accumulator is simply a 23-bit value to which a certain number is added on every
// clock cycle (each time the Ï†2 pin transitions high). The accumulator is allowed to
// overflow and lose the most significant bit, which has the result of "resetting" it to
// near zero on a regular basis. This produces a sawtooth-shaped waveform.
//
// The number that is added to the PAO on each clock cycle is the value in the FREHI and
// FRELO registers. A higher number will cause the oscillator to overflow more frequently,
// producing a waveform of a higher frequency.
//
// This is known as a "phase accumulator" because the normal *next* step in waveform
// generation is to consult a lookup table with the values of sines for the accumulator
// value. Thus, the PA is actually determining the phase of the sine wave so produced. The
// 6581 does not produce sine waves because there was not enough room on the chip to add
// such a sine lookup table (the PA waveform itself is output as a sawtooth wave), but it is
// still referred to as a phase accumulator.
//
// The PA result is then fed into four waveform generators, one each for triangle, sawtooth,
// pulse, and noise waveforms. Which if these is enabled is controlled by the VCREG
// register. Multiple waveform generators can be enabled at once; when this is done, the
// output value at each clock cycle is the values of all enabled waveform generators,
// logically ANDed together.
