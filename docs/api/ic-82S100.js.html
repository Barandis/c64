/**
 * An emulation of the 82S100 Programmable Logic Array, as it was
 * programmed for early Commodore 64's.
 *
 * The 82S100 is a programmable logic chip made by Signetics and is
 * regarded as the very first programmable logic device, first released
 * in 1975. It took 16 inputs and could form up to 48 product terms
 * (P-terms) by logically ANDind and NOTing selections of the 16 inputs.
 * These P-terms were then fed to another array that would logically OR
 * them selectively, producing up to 8 sum terms (S-terms) that were
 * ultimately sent to the output pins (possibly after NOTing them
 * first). The programming for these P- and S-terms could be done in the
 * field in a similar manner to that of a PROM (programmable read-only
 * memory), and Commodore would program them as a part of production of
 * the C64.
 *
 * A single 82S100 could therefore serve the same function as a large
 * number of 7400-series logic devices, for instance. It was used in a
 * vast array of machines, including other Commodore computers and disk
 * drives and those from several other companies. The differences
 * between the 82S100's used in each would be the programming of the
 * logic arrays.
 *
 * CBM eventually created their own hard-coded versions of the 82S100,
 * which were faster and were cheaper for CBM to produce than it was for
 * them to buy and program 82S100's. The schematic from which this
 * emulation is being produced is an early one, from July, 1982, and at
 * that time the C64 was still using the Signetics device.
 *
 * The input pins of the 82S100 were generically named I0-I15, and the
 * output pins were similarly named F0-F7. That has been maintained
 * here, though constants are provided to be able to use the more
 * C64-centric names that reflect the pins' actual functions in that
 * computer.
 *
 * This chip was tasked with providing the chip enable signals for the
 * C64's RAM and color RAM; BASIC, kernal, and character ROM; registers
 * from the {@link Ic6526|6526 CIAs}, {@link Ic6567|6567 VIC}, and
 * {@link Ic6581|6581 SID}; and two banks of cartridge ROM and two banks
 * of cartridge I/O memory. The 6510 processor, having a 16-bit address
 * bus, could access 64k of memory, but all of this RAM and ROM together
 * added up to closer to 84k. Therefore the PLA used a combination of
 * inputs, including some of the address bus, the specialized 6510 I/O
 * port bus, and signals from the VIC and cartridge ROMs to determine
 * which memory was trying to be accessed at any given time, and then
 * provide chip enable signals for that memory (turning it on and
 * turning other memory that could be at the same address off). It would
 * do this for every memory access, which would happen twice per cycle
 * (half the cycle was used by the CPU, half by the VIC). Thus bank
 * switching actually happened at a frequency of 2MHz, twice the CPU
 * clock frequency, and the chip generated a fair bit of heat.
 *
 * The purpose of the logic in the PLA is to take the current state of
 * the system during a memory access and produce a single output
 * enabling the one device (memory chip, processor chip with register,
 * cartridge, etc.) that will handle that memory access. (If the
 * selected output is _IO, that indicates that the I/O block of memory
 * is being accessed, but the PLA cannot determine *which* device is
 * being accessed from this information alone. When that happens, a
 * separate demultiplexer uses `A8`-`A11` to determine which device it
 * is.)
 *
 * ### Input pin assignments
 *
 * * **`I0`: `_CAS`,** This is the control line from the VIC that
 *     enables access to RAM. Instead of going directly to RAM, this
 *     line comes to the PLA and if RAM access is selected, the _CASRAM
 *     output is sent to the RAM chips.
 * * **`I1`: `_LORAM`.** This line controls the memory block from 0xA000
 *     - 0xBFFF. When high (normal), the BASIC ROM is available in this
 *       memory block. When low, it's switched out for RAM.
 * * **`I2`: `_HIRAM`.** This line controls the memory area from
 *     $E000...$FFFF. When high (normal), the KERNAL ROM is available in
 *     this memory block. When low, it's switched out for RAM.
 * * **`I3`: `_CHAREN`.** This line partially controls the memory block
 *     from $D000...$DFFF. When high (normal), the I/O devices appear in
 *     this memory block. When low, the character ROM appears here
 *     instead. This line can be overridden by other signals, including
 *     those allowing this memory block to contain RAM instead.
 * * **`I4`, `I14-I15`: `_VA14`, `VA13`, and `VA12`.** When the VIC is
 *     active, these are used to determine which block of memory the VIC
 *     is trying to access. `_VA14` is active low because that's the way
 *     it's generated by CIA2; it's inverted back into active high
 *     before being used to access memory but not for use with the PLA.
 * * **`I5`-`I8`: `A15`-`A12`.** Used to determine which block of memory
 *     the CPU wishes to access while the CPU is active.
 * * **`I9`: `BA`.** The VIC sets this "Bus Available" line high to
 *     indicate normal bus operation, switching between VIC and CPU each
 *     cycle. The VIC sets it low when it intends to take exclusive
 *     access of the address bus.
 * * **`I10`: `_AEC`.** This inverse of the VIC's "Address Enable
 *     Control" signal indicates which of the CPU (low) or VIC (high) is
 *     in control of the data bus.
 * * **`I11`: `R__W`.** This is generally written `R/_W`, but the slash
 *     is not a character that can be used in property names without
 *     quoting it. A high signal means that memory is being read, while
 *     a low means memory is being written. This makes a difference to
 *     what memory is being accessed. For example, ROM cannot be
 *     written; if an attempt is made to write to a ROM address while
 *     ROM is banked in, the write will happen to RAM instead.
 * * **`I12`-`I13`: `_GAME` and `_EXROM`.** These are used by cartridges
 *     to indicate the presence of addressable memory within them. There
 *     are two for-sure states for these two signals: if both are high
 *     (the normal state), there is no cartridge; and if `_EXROM` is
 *     high and `_GAME` is low, there is an Ultimax cartridge. Further
 *     mapping to cartridge ROM depends not only on these two signals
 *     but also on `_LORAM`, `_HIRAM`, and `_CHAREN`; [there is a nice
 *     table here][2].
 *
 * [2]: https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Bank_Switching#Mode_Table
 *
 * ### Output pin assignments
 *
 * Since the outputs are fed to chip select pins, which are universally
 * active low, all of these are programmed to be inverted. Thus, at last
 * seven of them will be high at any given time and at most one will be
 * low.
 *
 * * **`F0`: `_CASRAM`.** This is the signal that ultimately enables
 *     RAM. The production of this signal is very different from the
 *     others. For all other output, if one of their terms is selected,
 *     that output will be selected. For `_CASRAM`, its terms are
 *     combined with the terms from all other outputs (except for
 *     `GR/_W`), and if any of the terms are selected, then `_CASRAM`
 *     will be *de*selected. (Even if all of those other outputs are
 *     deselected, `_CASRAM` will be deselected if `_CAS` is high or if
 *     certain addresses are accessed while an Ultimax cartridge is
 *     plugged in. In these cases, no PLA outputs will be selected.)
 * * **`F1`: `_BASIC`.** Enables the BASIC ROM.
 * * **`F2`: `_KERNAL`.** Enables the KERNAL ROM.
 * * **`F3`: `_CHAROM`.** Enables the Character ROM.
 * * **`F4`: `GR__W`.** (written `GR/_W` where slashes are legal.)
 *     Indicates that the static color RAM is being written to. Note
 *     that this is the only output that is not actually a chip enable
 *     signal; color RAM is possibly enabled if the `_IO` output is
 *     selected (see `{@link Ic74139}` for details).
 * * **`F5`: `_IO`.** Indicates that one of the following are going to
 *     be enabled: CIA1 registers, CIA2 registers, VIC registers, SID
 *     registers, color RAM, expansion port I/O from address 0xDE00 -
 *     0xDEFF, or expansion port I/O from address 0xDF00 - 0xDFFF. Which
 *     of these is actually enabled is done by decoding `A8`-`A11`,
 *     which is done by the {@link Ic74139|74139}.
 * * **`F6`: `_ROML`.** Enables expansion port ROM from 0x8000 - 0x9FFF.
 * * **`F7`: `_ROMH`.** Enables expansion port ROM from 0xE000 - 0xEFFF.
 *
 * There is a ton of information about the internal workings of the
 * C64's version of the 82S100 in [The C64 PLA Dissected][1]. This
 * document was used to derive all of the logic in this object and has a
 * number of interesting stories besides (if you find that sort of thing
 * interesting).
 *
 * [1]: http://skoe.de/docs/c64-dissected/pla/c64_pla_dissected_a4ds.pdf
 *
 * Additionally, the 82S100 has an active-low chip enable pin `_CE`
 * which is not used in the Commodore 64 (it is tied directly to ground
 * and therefore is always low, so the chip is always enabled). There is
 * also an `FE` pin that was used for programming the chip in the field;
 * the emulated chip from the C64 doesn't use this as the chip was
 * programmed during manufacturing.
 *
 * The chip comes in a 28-pin dual in-line package with the following
 * pin assignments.
 * ```txt

 * was not programmed in the field for the Commodore 64, and it is not
