/**
 * An emulation of the 4164 64k x 1 bit dynamic RAM.
 *
 * The 4164 is a basic DRAM chip that was used in a wide variety of home
 * computers in the 1980's: the Apple IIe, IIc, and 128k Macintosh; the
 * Atari 800XL; the Commodore 64 and 128; and the Radio Shack Color
 * Computer 2. Later editions of the Apple IIc, Commodore 64, Commodore
 * 128, and COCO2 switched to the 4464.
 *
 * This chip has a memory array of 65,536 bits, each associated with an
 * individual memory address. Therefore, to use a 4164 in an 8-bit
 * computer, 8 chips would be required to provide 64k of memory (128k
 * Macintosh and Commodore 128 would therefore use 16 of these chips).
 * Each chip was used for a single bit in the target address; bit 0
 * would be stored in the first 4164, bit 1 in the second 4164, and so
 * on.
 *
 * Since the chip has only 8 address pins, an address has to be split
 * into two parts, representing a row and a column (presenting the
 * memory array as a physical 256-bit x 256-bit array). These row and
 * column addresses are provided to the chip sequentially; the row
 * address is put onto the address pins and  the active-low row address
 * strobe pin `_RAS` is set low, then the column address is put onto the
 * address pins and the active-low column address strobe pin `_CAS` is
 * set low.
 *
 * The chip has three basic modes of operation, controlled by the
 * active-low write-enable (`_WE`) pin with some help from `_CAS`. If
 * `_WE` is high, then the chip is in read mode after the address is
 * set. If `_WE` is low, the mode depends on whether `_WE` went low
 * before the address was set by putting `_CAS` low; if `_CAS` went low
 * first, (meaning the chip was initially in read mode), setting `_WE`
 * low will start read-modify-write mode, where the value at that
 * address is still available on the data-out pin (`Q`) even as the new
 * value is set from the data-in pin (`D`). If `_WE` goes low before
 * `_CAS`, then read mode is never entered and write mode is enabled
 * instead. The value of `D` is still written to memory, but `Q` is
 * disconnected and no data is available there.
 *
 * The Commodore 64 does not use read-modify-write mode. The `_WE` pin
 * is always set to its proper level before the `_CAS` pin goes low.
 *
 * While `_WE` and `_CAS` control what is read from and/or written to
 * the chip's memory, `_RAS` is not needed for anything other than
 * setting the row address. Hence `_RAS` can remain low through multiple
 * memory accesses, as long as its address is valid for all of them,
 * allowing reads and writes to happen within a single 256-address page
 * of memory without incurring the cost of resetting the row address.
 *
 * Unlike most other non-logic chips in the system, there is no
 * dedicated chip-select pin. The combination of `_RAS` and `_CAS` can
 * be regarded as such a pin, and it is used that way in the Commodore
 * 64.
 *
 * The chip comes in a 16-pin dual in-line package with the following
 * pin assignments.
 * ```txt
 *         +---+--+---+
 *      NC |1  +--+ 16| Vss
 *       D |2       15| _CAS
 *     _WE |3       14| Q
 *    _RAS |4       13| A6
 *      A0 |5  4164 12| A3
 *      A2 |6       11| A4
 *      A1 |7       10| A5
 *     Vcc |8        9| A7
 *         +----------+
 * ```
 * *(`Vss` and `Vcc` are ground and power supply pins respectively, and
 * they are not emulated. `NC` stands for "no contact" and is not
 * connected to anything internally.)*
 *
 * In the Commodore 64, U9, U10, U11, U12, U21, U22, U23, and U24 are
 * 4164's, one for each of the 8 bits on the data bus.
 *
 * This chip is produced by calling the
 * `{@link module:chips.Ic4164|Ic4164}` function.
 *
 * @typedef Ic4164
 * @property {Pin} _RAS [4] The active-low row address strobe pin. When
 *     this pin transitions to low, the value on the 8 address pins is
 *     latched and remembered as 8 bits of the final address.
 * @property {Pin} _CAS [15] The active-low column address strobe pin.
 *     When this pin transitions to low, the value on the 8 address pins
 *     is latched and remembered as other 8 bits of the final address.
 *     If the `_WE` is high at this time, a bit is read from the final
 *     address and put onto the `Q` pin; if `_WE is low, the value on
 *     the `D` pin is stored at the final address.
 * @property {Pin} _WE [3] The active-low write enable pin. If this pin
 *     is low when `_CAS` goes low, the bit on the `D` pin will be
 *     written to memory. If it's high, a bit read from memory will be
 *     put on the `Q` pin.
 * @property {Pin} D [2] The data input pin.
 * @property {Pin} Q [14] The data output pin.
 * @property {Pin} A0 [5] Address pin 0.
 * @property {Pin} A1 [7] Address pin 1.
 * @property {Pin} A2 [6] Address pin 2.
 * @property {Pin} A3 [12] Address pin 3.
 * @property {Pin} A4 [11] Address pin 4.
 * @property {Pin} A5 [10] Address pin 5.
 * @property {Pin} A6 [13] Address pin 6.
 * @property {Pin} A7 [9] Address pin 7.
 * @property {Pin} NC [1] No contact. This pin is not connected to
 *     anything internally; the chip only needs 15 pins and this one is
 *     included to make the physical package a 16-pin DIP.
 * @property {Pin} Vcc [8] The positive power supply. This pin is not
 *     emulated.
 * @property {Pin} Vss [16] The ground. This pin is not emulated.
