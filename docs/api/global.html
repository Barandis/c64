<div class="description usertext">
    <p>An emulation of the 82S100 Programmable Logic Array, as it was
programmed for early Commodore 64's.</p>
<p>The 82S100 is a programmable logic chip made by Signetics and is
regarded as the very first programmable logic device, first released
in 1975. It took 16 inputs and could form up to 48 product terms
(P-terms) by logically ANDind and NOTing selections of the 16 inputs.
These P-terms were then fed to another array that would logically OR
them selectively, producing up to 8 sum terms (S-terms) that were
ultimately sent to the output pins (possibly after NOTing them
first). The programming for these P- and S-terms could be done in the
field in a similar manner to that of a PROM (programmable read-only
memory), and Commodore would program them as a part of production of
the C64.</p>
<p>A single 82S100 could therefore serve the same function as a large
number of 7400-series logic devices, for instance. It was used in a
vast array of machines, including other Commodore computers and disk
drives and those from several other companies. The differences
between the 82S100's used in each would be the programming of the
logic arrays.</p>
<p>CBM eventually created their own hard-coded versions of the 82S100,
which were faster and were cheaper for CBM to produce than it was for
them to buy and program 82S100's. The schematic from which this
emulation is being produced is an early one, from July, 1982, and at
that time the C64 was still using the Signetics device.</p>
<p>The input pins of the 82S100 were generically named I0-I15, and the
output pins were similarly named F0-F7. That has been maintained
here, though constants are provided to be able to use the more
C64-centric names that reflect the pins' actual functions in that
computer.</p>
<p>This chip was tasked with providing the chip enable signals for the
C64's RAM and color RAM; BASIC, kernal, and character ROM; registers
from the <a href="global.html#Ic6526">6526 CIAs</a>, 6567 VIC, and
6581 SID; and two banks of cartridge ROM and two banks
of cartridge I/O memory. The 6510 processor, having a 16-bit address
bus, could access 64k of memory, but all of this RAM and ROM together
added up to closer to 84k. Therefore the PLA used a combination of
inputs, including some of the address bus, the specialized 6510 I/O
port bus, and signals from the VIC and cartridge ROMs to determine
which memory was trying to be accessed at any given time, and then
provide chip enable signals for that memory (turning it on and
turning other memory that could be at the same address off). It would
do this for every memory access, which would happen twice per cycle
(half the cycle was used by the CPU, half by the VIC). Thus bank
switching actually happened at a frequency of 2MHz, twice the CPU
clock frequency, and the chip generated a fair bit of heat.</p>
<p>The purpose of the logic in the PLA is to take the current state of
the system during a memory access and produce a single output
enabling the one device (memory chip, processor chip with register,
cartridge, etc.) that will handle that memory access. (If the
selected output is _IO, that indicates that the I/O block of memory
is being accessed, but the PLA cannot determine <em>which</em> device is
being accessed from this information alone. When that happens, a
separate demultiplexer uses <code>A8</code>-<code>A11</code> to determine which device it
is.)</p>
<h3>Input pin assignments</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>I0</code>: <code>_CAS</code>,</strong> This is the control line from the VIC that
enables access to RAM. Instead of going directly to RAM, this
line comes to the PLA and if RAM access is selected, the _CASRAM
output is sent to the RAM chips.</li>
<li><strong><code>I1</code>: <code>_LORAM</code>.</strong> This line controls the memory block from 0xA000
<ul>
<li>0xBFFF. When high (normal), the BASIC ROM is available in this
memory block. When low, it's switched out for RAM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><code>I2</code>: <code>_HIRAM</code>.</strong> This line controls the memory area from
$E000...$FFFF. When high (normal), the KERNAL ROM is available in
this memory block. When low, it's switched out for RAM.</li>
<li><strong><code>I3</code>: <code>_CHAREN</code>.</strong> This line partially controls the memory block
from $D000...$DFFF. When high (normal), the I/O devices appear in
this memory block. When low, the character ROM appears here
instead. This line can be overridden by other signals, including
those allowing this memory block to contain RAM instead.</li>
<li><strong><code>I4</code>, <code>I14-I15</code>: <code>_VA14</code>, <code>VA13</code>, and <code>VA12</code>.</strong> When the VIC is
active, these are used to determine which block of memory the VIC
is trying to access. <code>_VA14</code> is active low because that's the way
it's generated by CIA2; it's inverted back into active high
before being used to access memory but not for use with the PLA.</li>
<li><strong><code>I5</code>-<code>I8</code>: <code>A15</code>-<code>A12</code>.</strong> Used to determine which block of memory
the CPU wishes to access while the CPU is active.</li>
<li><strong><code>I9</code>: <code>BA</code>.</strong> The VIC sets this &quot;Bus Available&quot; line high to
indicate normal bus operation, switching between VIC and CPU each
cycle. The VIC sets it low when it intends to take exclusive
access of the address bus.</li>
<li><strong><code>I10</code>: <code>_AEC</code>.</strong> This inverse of the VIC's &quot;Address Enable
Control&quot; signal indicates which of the CPU (low) or VIC (high) is
in control of the data bus.</li>
<li><strong><code>I11</code>: <code>R__W</code>.</strong> This is generally written <code>R/_W</code>, but the slash
is not a character that can be used in property names without
quoting it. A high signal means that memory is being read, while
a low means memory is being written. This makes a difference to
what memory is being accessed. For example, ROM cannot be
written; if an attempt is made to write to a ROM address while
ROM is banked in, the write will happen to RAM instead.</li>
<li><strong><code>I12</code>-<code>I13</code>: <code>_GAME</code> and <code>_EXROM</code>.</strong> These are used by cartridges
to indicate the presence of addressable memory within them. There
are two for-sure states for these two signals: if both are high
(the normal state), there is no cartridge; and if <code>_EXROM</code> is
high and <code>_GAME</code> is low, there is an Ultimax cartridge. Further
mapping to cartridge ROM depends not only on these two signals
but also on <code>_LORAM</code>, <code>_HIRAM</code>, and <code>_CHAREN</code>; <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Bank_Switching#Mode_Table">there is a nice
table here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output pin assignments</h3>
<p>Since the outputs are fed to chip select pins, which are universally
active low, all of these are programmed to be inverted. Thus, at last
seven of them will be high at any given time and at most one will be
low.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>F0</code>: <code>_CASRAM</code>.</strong> This is the signal that ultimately enables
RAM. The production of this signal is very different from the
others. For all other output, if one of their terms is selected,
that output will be selected. For <code>_CASRAM</code>, its terms are
combined with the terms from all other outputs (except for
<code>GR/_W</code>), and if any of the terms are selected, then <code>_CASRAM</code>
will be <em>de</em>selected. (Even if all of those other outputs are
deselected, <code>_CASRAM</code> will be deselected if <code>_CAS</code> is high or if
certain addresses are accessed while an Ultimax cartridge is
plugged in. In these cases, no PLA outputs will be selected.)</li>
<li><strong><code>F1</code>: <code>_BASIC</code>.</strong> Enables the BASIC ROM.</li>
<li><strong><code>F2</code>: <code>_KERNAL</code>.</strong> Enables the KERNAL ROM.</li>
<li><strong><code>F3</code>: <code>_CHAROM</code>.</strong> Enables the Character ROM.</li>
<li><strong><code>F4</code>: <code>GR__W</code>.</strong> (written <code>GR/_W</code> where slashes are legal.)
Indicates that the static color RAM is being written to. Note
that this is the only output that is not actually a chip enable
signal; color RAM is possibly enabled if the <code>_IO</code> output is
selected (see <code><a href="global.html#Ic74139">Ic74139</a></code> for details).</li>
<li><strong><code>F5</code>: <code>_IO</code>.</strong> Indicates that one of the following are going to
be enabled: CIA1 registers, CIA2 registers, VIC registers, SID
registers, color RAM, expansion port I/O from address 0xDE00 -
0xDEFF, or expansion port I/O from address 0xDF00 - 0xDFFF. Which
of these is actually enabled is done by decoding <code>A8</code>-<code>A11</code>,
which is done by the <a href="global.html#Ic74139">74139</a>.</li>
<li><strong><code>F6</code>: <code>_ROML</code>.</strong> Enables expansion port ROM from 0x8000 - 0x9FFF.</li>
<li><strong><code>F7</code>: <code>_ROMH</code>.</strong> Enables expansion port ROM from 0xE000 - 0xEFFF.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a ton of information about the internal workings of the
C64's version of the 82S100 in <a href="http://skoe.de/docs/c64-dissected/pla/c64_pla_dissected_a4ds.pdf">The C64 PLA Dissected</a>. This
document was used to derive all of the logic in this object and has a
number of interesting stories besides (if you find that sort of thing
interesting).</p>
<p>Additionally, the 82S100 has an active-low chip enable pin <code>_CE</code>
which is not used in the Commodore 64 (it is tied directly to ground
and therefore is always low, so the chip is always enabled). There is
also an <code>FE</code> pin that was used for programming the chip in the field;
the emulated chip from the C64 doesn't use this as the chip was
programmed during manufacturing.</p>
<p>The chip comes in a 28-pin dual in-line package with the following
pin assignments.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-txt"><code>        +-----+--+-----+
     FE |1    +--+   28| Vcc
     I7 |2           27| I8

     F5 |12          17| F1
     F4 |13          16| F2
    Vss |14          15| F3
        +--------------+
</code></pre>
<p><em>(<code>Vss</code> and <code>Vcc</code> are ground and power supply pins respectively, and
they are not emulated. <code>FE</code> is the field programming pin; this chip
was not programmed in the field for the Commodore 64, and it is not
emulated either.)</em></p>
<p>In the Commodore 64, U17 is an 82S100. As detailed extensively above,
it was used to decode signals to determine which chip would receive a
particular read or write.</p>
<p>This chip is produced by calling the
<code><a href="module-chips.html#.Ic82S100">Ic82S100</a></code> function.</p>

<div class="description usertext">
    <p>An emulation of the 2114 1k x 4 bit static RAM.</p>
<p>Static RAM differs from dynamic RAM (the RAM generally used for
computer memory) in that it doesn't require periodic refresh cycles
in order to retain data. Since no reads or writes have to wait for
these refresh cycles, static RAM is considerably faster than dynamic
RAM.</p>
<p>However, it's also considerably more expensive. For this reason,
static RAM is generally only in use in particularly speed-sensitive
applications and in relatively small amounts. For instance, modern
CPU on-board cache RAM is static. The Commodore 64 uses it for color
RAM, which is accessed by the VIC at a much higher speed than the
DRAM is accessed by the CPU.</p>
<p>The 2114 has 1024 addressable locations that hold 4 bits each. Since
the Commodore 64 has a fixed palette of 16 colors, 4 bits is all it
needs. Therefore a single 2114 could store 1k of colors and it isn't
necessary to use it with a second 2114 to store full 8-bit bytes.</p>
<p>The timing of reads and writes is particularly simple. If the chip
select pin <code>_CS</code> is low, the 4 bits stored at the location given on
its address pins is put onto the 4 data pins. If the write enable pin
<code>_WE</code> is also low, then the value on the 4 data pins is stored at the
location given on its address pins. The <code>_CS</code> pin can stay low for
several cycles of reads and writes; it does not require <code>_CS</code> to
return to high to start the next cycle.</p>
<p>The downside of this simple scheme is that care has to be taken to
avoid unwanted writes. Address changes should not take place while
both <code>_CS</code> and <code>_WE</code> are low; since address lines do not change
simultaneously, changing addresses while both pins are low can and
will cause data to be written to multiple addresses, potentially
overwriting legitimate data. This is naturally emulated here for the
same reason: the chip responds to address line changes, and those
changes do not happen simultaneously.</p>
<p>Aside from the active-low <code>_CS</code> and <code>_WE</code> pins, this simple memory
device only has the necessary address pins to address 1k of memory
and the four necessary bidirectional data pins. It's packages in an
18-pin dual-inline package with the following pin assignments.</p>

    <p>An emulation of the 2332 4k x 8-bit ROM.</p>
<p>This, along with the similar 2364, is far and away the simplest
memory chip in the Commodore 64. With its full complement of address
pins and full 8 data pins, there is no need to use multiple chips or
to multiplex addresses.</p>
<p>Timing of the read cycle (there is, of course, no write cycle in a
read-only memory chip) is done with a pair of active-low chip select
pins, <code>_CS1</code> and <code>_CS2</code>. When both are low, the chip reads its
address pins and makes the value at that location available on its
data pins. In the C64, <code>_CS2</code> is tied to ground, meaning <code>CS1</code> is the
only pin that needs to be manipulated.</p>
<p>The chip comes in a 24-pin dual in-line package with the following
pin assignments.</p>

    <p>An emulation of the 2364 8k x 8-bit ROM.</p>
<p>This, along with the similar 23632, is far and away the simplest
memory chip in the Commodore 64. With its full complement of address
pins and full 8 data pins, there is no need to use multiple chips or
to multiplex addresses.</p>
<p>Timing of the read cycle (there is, of course, no write cycle in a
read-only memory chip) is based solely on the chip select pin <code>_CS</code>.
When this pin goes low, the chip reads its address pins and makes the
value at that location available on its data pins.</p>
<p>The chip comes in a 24-pin dual in-line package with the following
pin assignments.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-txt"><code>        +-----+--+-----+
     A7 |1    +--+   24| Vcc

</code></pre>
<p><em>(<code>GND</code> and <code>Vcc</code> are ground and power supply pins respectively, and
they are not emulated.)</em></p>
<p>In the Commodore 64, U3 and U4 are both 2364A's (a variant with
slightly faster data access). U3 stores the BASIC interpreter and U4
stores the kernal.</p>

    <p>An emulation of the 4066 quad bilateral switch.</p>
<p>The 4066 is one of the 4000-series CMOS logic chips, consisting of
four symmetrical analong switches. The data pins transfer data
bidirectionally as long as their associated control pin is low. When
the control pin goes hish, no data can be passed through the switch.</p>
<p>When the control pin returns to low, both data pins return to the
level of the <em>last of them to be set</em>. This is a bit of a compromise
necessitated by the fact that this is a digital simulation of an
analog circuit, but it should be the most natural. Most use cases do
not involve switching the direction that data flows through the
switch regularly.</p>
<p>There is no high-impedance state for the pins of this device. When
the control pin his high, the data pins simply take on the level of
whatever circuits they're connected to. This is emulated by changing
their mode to <code>INPUT</code> so that they do
not send signals but can still track changes on their traces.</p>
<p>There is no consistency across datahsheets for naming the 4066's
pins. Many sheets simply have some data pins marked &quot;IN/OUT&quot; and
others marked &quot;OUT/IN&quot;, but those don't work well as property names.
For consistency with the rest of the logic chips in this module, the
data pins have been named <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, while thie control pin is
named <code>X</code>. The <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> pins are completely interchangeable and do
appear in different orders oon many datasheets; this particular
arrangement (if not the pin names) is taken from the datasheet for
the Texas Instruments CD4066B.</p>
<p>The chip comes in a 14-pin dual in-line package with the following
pin assignments.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-txt"><code>        +---+--+---+
     A1 |1  +--+ 14| Vdd
     B1 |2       13| X1
     B2 |3       12| X4
     A2 |4  4066 11| A4
     X2 |5       10| B4
     X3 |6        9| B3
    Vss |7        8| A3
        +----------+
</code></pre>
<p><em>(<code>Vdd</code> and <code>Vss</code> are power supply pins and are not emulated.)</em></p>
<p>This chip is unusual in that it's the only analog chip in the system
as emulated (with the exception of the filter portion of the
6581). Even so, it works fine for switching digital
signals as well, and one of the Commodore 64's two 4066's is in fact
used as a digital switch.</p>
<p>In the Commodore 64, U16 and U28 are 4066's. The former is used as a
digital switch to control which processor has access to the color
RAM's data pins, while the other is used as an analog switch to
control which game port is providing paddle data to the
6581 SID.</p>
<p>This chip is produced by calling the
<code><a href="module-chips.html#.Ic4066">Ic4066</a></code> function.</p>

<div class="description usertext">
    <p>An emulation of the 4164 64k x 1 bit dynamic RAM.</p>
<p>The 4164 is a basic DRAM chip that was used in a wide variety of home
computers in the 1980's: the Apple IIe, IIc, and 128k Macintosh; the
Atari 800XL; the Commodore 64 and 128; and the Radio Shack Color
Computer 2. Later editions of the Apple IIc, Commodore 64, Commodore
128, and COCO2 switched to the 4464.</p>
<p>This chip has a memory array of 65,536 bits, each associated with an
individual memory address. Therefore, to use a 4164 in an 8-bit
computer, 8 chips would be required to provide 64k of memory (128k
Macintosh and Commodore 128 would therefore use 16 of these chips).
Each chip was used for a single bit in the target address; bit 0
would be stored in the first 4164, bit 1 in the second 4164, and so
on.</p>
<p>Since the chip has only 8 address pins, an address has to be split
into two parts, representing a row and a column (presenting the
memory array as a physical 256-bit x 256-bit array). These row and
column addresses are provided to the chip sequentially; the row
address is put onto the address pins and  the active-low row address
strobe pin <code>_RAS</code> is set low, then the column address is put onto the
address pins and the active-low column address strobe pin <code>_CAS</code> is
set low.</p>
<p>The chip has three basic modes of operation, controlled by the
active-low write-enable (<code>_WE</code>) pin with some help from <code>_CAS</code>. If
<code>_WE</code> is high, then the chip is in read mode after the address is
set. If <code>_WE</code> is low, the mode depends on whether <code>_WE</code> went low
before the address was set by putting <code>_CAS</code> low; if <code>_CAS</code> went low
first, (meaning the chip was initially in read mode), setting <code>_WE</code>
low will start read-modify-write mode, where the value at that
address is still available on the data-out pin (<code>Q</code>) even as the new
value is set from the data-in pin (<code>D</code>). If <code>_WE</code> goes low before
<code>_CAS</code>, then read mode is never entered and write mode is enabled
instead. The value of <code>D</code> is still written to memory, but <code>Q</code> is
disconnected and no data is available there.</p>
<p>The Commodore 64 does not use read-modify-write mode. The <code>_WE</code> pin
is always set to its proper level before the <code>_CAS</code> pin goes low.</p>
<p>While <code>_WE</code> and <code>_CAS</code> control what is read from and/or written to
the chip's memory, <code>_RAS</code> is not needed for anything other than
setting the row address. Hence <code>_RAS</code> can remain low through multiple
memory accesses, as long as its address is valid for all of them,
allowing reads and writes to happen within a single 256-address page
of memory without incurring the cost of resetting the row address.</p>
<p>Unlike most other non-logic chips in the system, there is no
dedicated chip-select pin. The combination of <code>_RAS</code> and <code>_CAS</code> can
be regarded as such a pin, and it is used that way in the Commodore
64.</p>
<p>The chip comes in a 16-pin dual in-line package with the following
pin assignments.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-txt"><code>        +---+--+---+
     NC |1  +--+ 16| Vss
      D |2       15| _CAS
    _WE |3       14| Q
   _RAS |4       13| A6

        +----------+
</code></pre>
<p><em>(<code>Vss</code> and <code>Vcc</code> are ground and power supply pins respectively, and
they are not emulated. <code>NC</code> stands for &quot;no contact&quot; and is not
connected to anything internally.)</em></p>
<p>In the Commodore 64, U9, U10, U11, U12, U21, U22, U23, and U24 are
4164's, one for each of the 8 bits on the data bus.</p>
<p>This chip is produced by calling the
<code><a href="module-chips.html#.Ic4164">Ic4164</a></code> function.</p>

<h2>Parallel Data Ports</h2>
<p>The pins <code>PA0</code>-<code>PA7</code> and <code>PB0</code>-<code>PB7</code> make up the two parallel data
ports. The direction of each pin (input or output) is controlled
individually by the corresponding bit in the Data Direction Register
for each port. Setting a bit to 1 means that that pin is being used
as an output; a 0 sets it to an input instead.</p>
<p>The parallel data registers, when read, return the state of the
port's pins at that time, whether the pin is an input or an output.
Writing to the parallel data registers sets the value of a pin (as
long as it's an output pin, bits associated with input pins are
ignored).</p>
<p>Port B additionally can be used as outputs for the timers; <code>PB6</code> can
signal for Timer A and <code>PB7</code> for Timer B. To do this, the <code>PBON</code> bit
in the appropriate control register (<code>CRA</code> or <code>CRB</code>) must be set. The
output mode is set with the <code>OUTMODE</code> bit in the same register.
Setting this bit means that the output pin will toggle levels each
time the timer reaches 0; clearing it means that a one-cycle-long
high pulse will happen each time the timer reaches 0. This setting
overrides the input/output settings; as long as one of the <code>PBON</code>
bits is set, that Port B pin will be an output whatever is set in
<code>DDRB</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>_PC</code> pin is associated with Port B. Each time Parallel
Data Register B is read or written, the <code>_PC</code> pin will go low for one
cycle. This is useful as a signal that either the port's data has
been accepted or that the port has data ready to be received.</p>
<h2>Interval Timers</h2>
<p>The two interval timers each track their countdown in pairs of
registers - <code>TALO</code> and <code>TAHI</code> for Timer A and <code>TBLO</code> and <code>TBHI</code> for
timer B - allowing them to count a maximum of 65,536 cycles. The
timers can count clock cycles (provided on pin <code>φ2</code>) or transitions
of the <code>CNT</code> pin to high. Given clock cycles with a 1 MHz clock
frequency (typical of a Commodore 64), this makes for a maximum
interval of about 0.066 seconds.</p>
<p>Timer B can additionally count the number of times that Timer A
reaches zero (called &quot;underflow&quot; in the literature) or the number of
times that Timer A reaches zero while the <code>CNT</code> pin is high. By
setting Timer A to count clock cycles and Timer B to count Timer A
underflows, a maximum interval of over 71 minutes can be achieved.</p>
<p>The type of event to count is set in the control registers. <code>CRA</code> has
a bit called <code>INMODE</code>; if this is 0, Timer A counts clock cycles, and
if it's 1, Timer A counts <code>CNT</code> transitions. For Timer B, <code>CRB</code> has
<em>two</em> bits (<code>INMODE0</code> and <code>INMODE1</code>). A value of 00 or 01 on these
bits is the same as for Timer A, but 10 causes Timer B to count Timer
A underflows and 11 means Timer B will count only the Timer A
underflows that happen when the <code>CNT</code> pin is high.</p>
<p>Once a timer reaches zero, a number of things can happen. First, an
interrupt request may be signaled. This requires that the <code>TA</code> or
<code>TB</code> bits in the register <code>ICR</code> be set. Secondly, an output can be
signaled on <code>PB6</code> (for Timer A) or <code>PB7</code> (for Timer B). Details of
this have already been discussed in the &quot;Parallel Data Ports&quot;
section. Finally, the timer is reset and the decision is made to
either stop there or to continue counting down. This is controlled by
the <code>RUNMODE</code> bit in <code>CRA</code> or <code>CRB</code>. If this bit is 0, the timer
resets and continues running; if it is 1, the timer still resets but
does not re-run.</p>
<p>The four timer registers can be read at any time to see how many
cycles remain for their respective timers. <em>Writing</em> to these
registers is different. A write sets the value on a write-only shadow
register of sorts that is associated with the actual register. When
the register resets, the values in these shadow registers are what
are loaded into the actual register. Hence, when writing to these
registers, the values will not load into the actual register until
the next underflow for that timer.</p>
<p>The load will happen immediately if the <code>LOAD</code> bit of either <code>CRA</code> or
<code>CRB</code> are set. Whatever is in the countdown registers will be
overwritten with whatever is in the shadow registers at that point,
effectively starting the countdown over at the new value. The value
of <code>LOAD</code> is not stored; it is a strobe that causes the registers to
reload immediately when it is written.</p>
<p>Timer A may also be associated with the Serial Data Port. See that
section below for more details.</p>
<h2>Time of Day Clock</h2>
<p>The Time of Day (TOD) clock is a much more human-friendly sort of
timer. Rather than dealing with microseconds, the TOD's four
registers store hours (<code>TODHR</code>), minutes (<code>TODMIN</code>), seconds
(<code>TODSEC</code>), and tenths of seconds (<code>TOD10TH</code>). Once set, the TOD
clock keeps accurate time as long as the signals on the clock pins
are accurate.</p>
<p>Reading these registers reveals the current time, but it has to be
done in a particular manner. Reading <code>TODHR</code> causes all of the
registers to stop updating until <code>TOD10TH</code> is read. This is to ensure
that all four registers can be read at the same &quot;time&quot;. Otherwise, it
is possible (for example) to start reading the time at 1:59:59.9 and
have time second tick over before the read is finished, making the
first read happen before the hour changes and the others happen
after. If this happened, the time would appear to be 1:00:00.0 when
it really should be 2:00:00.0. The clock itself is not stopped during
this pause; the clock merely doesn't update the registers until
<code>TOD10THS</code> is next read.</p>
<p>Writing the TOD registers works the same way, with a couple of
additional caveats. First, the clock itself stops after <code>TODHR</code> is
written until <code>TOD10THS</code> is also written. Second, it is possible that
writing to these registers doesn't change the time at all; if the
<code>ALARM</code> bit of <code>CRB</code> is set, then writing these registers changes the
<em>alarm</em>, which is kept in shadow registers that can't be read.</p>
<p>The four registers assume their data to be in a different kind of
format: binary-coded decimal (BCD). In BCD, every four bits is used
to represent a decimal number rather than a hexadecimal number. In
this scheme, a register with the value 0000 1001 (09), after
incrementing, would hold the value 0001 0000 (10) instead of the
regular 0000 1010 (0A). This means several values are invalid, which
is never the case with regular binary numbers, but BCD is much easier
to translate into straight decimal.</p>
<p>Because of this BCD formatting, we know that the top four bits of
<code>TOD10TH</code> will always be 0 (since the highest number it will hold is
09). Similarly, the top bit of <code>TODSEC</code> and <code>TODMIN</code> (max values 59)
will always be 0. The top 3 bits of <code>TODHR</code> (max value 12; there is
no support for 24-hour time) would be always 0 except that bit 7
(<code>PM</code>) is used to indicate AM (0) or PM (1).</p>
<p>The clock operates on external clock pulses fed to the <code>TOD</code> pin. By
default, these pulses are expected to arrive at 60 Hz (in other
words, <code>TOD10THS</code> will be incremented after every sixth pulse). If
the <code>TODIN</code> bit of <code>CRA</code> is set, it will instead assume the clock
frequency is 50 Hz (and <code>TOD10THS</code> will instead be updated every
fifth clock pulse). Obviously, the accuracy of these pulses is
important to having the correct time.</p>
<p>When the clock reaches the same time as set in the alarm, an
interrupt request will be initiated if the <code>ALRM</code> bit of the <code>ICR</code>
register is set. Whether or not the interrupt is requested, the TOD
clock will simply keep ticking.</p>
<h2>Serial Data Port</h2>
<p>In addition to the two parallel data ports, the 6526 features a
single bidirectional serial data port. The serial port operates by
coordinating the <code>SDR</code> and <code>CRA</code> registers, Timer A, interrupts, and
the <code>SP</code> and <code>CNT</code> pins.</p>
<p>Whether the serial port is being used to send or receive data is
controlled by <code>SPMODE</code> bit of register <code>CRA</code> (0 for receive and 1 for
send). If receiving, the chip pushes a bit from the <code>SP</code> pin to an
internal shift register every time the <code>CNT</code> pin goes high (the
sending device is responsible for signaling <code>CNT</code>). Once 8 bits have
been received, they are deposited in the <code>SDR</code> register and an
interrupt request is generated.</p>
<p>If the chip is sending, the contents of <code>SDR</code> are first pulled into
the internal shift register. Timer A is used to clock the output;
every <em>other</em> time that Timer A underflows, a bit will be taken from
the shift register and put on the <code>SP</code> pin. At the same time, the
<code>CNT</code> pin will be set high to indicate that the bit is ready (this is
why the clock rate is half the Timer A underflow rate; the other
underflows are used to clear the <code>CNT</code> pin.) Once the entire byte is
sent, an interrupt request is generated; if the CPU had already put a
new byte into <code>SDR</code> the transmission will continue, otherwise it will
be paused until the next byte is ready.</p>
<h2>Control Registers</h2>
<p>Alongside the registers for the parallel ports, the interval timers,
the TOD clock, and the serial port, the 6526 has three control
registers. One controls the request of interrupts while the other two
control the interval timers, the TOD clock, and the serial port.</p>
<h3>Interrupt Control Register (<code>ICR</code>)</h3>
<p>The ICR has different functions depending on whether it's being read
from or written to. <em>Writing</em> to the ICR sets what interrupts should
be responded to. <em>Reading</em> from the ICR reveals what interrupt
conditions have been met and whether an interrupt request has
actually been signaled.</p>
<p>When written, the ICR looks like this.</p>

<p>Bits 0-4 are flags that represent the five sources of interrupts in
the 6526:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TA</code>: Timer A undeflow</li>
<li><code>TB</code>: Timer B undeflow</li>
<li><code>ALRM</code>: TOD Alarm</li>
<li><code>SP</code>: Serial Data Register being full (receive) or empty (send)</li>
<li><code>FLG</code>: The <code>_FLAG</code> pin going low</li>
</ul>
<p>This marks the first appearance of the <code>_FLAG</code> pin; this is simply a
pin that potentially requests an interrupt when it goes low. A
potential use of this is tying it to the <code>_PC</code> pin of another 6526 to
request an interrupt when parallel port data is sent or received
(there is no interrupt bit for that).</p>
<p>These bits are masks. If a bit is set, that indicates that the event
associated with that bit <em>will</em> fire an interrupt (i.e., the <code>_IRQ</code>
pin will go low) when that event happens. If that bit is cleared, the
event is still recorded, but no interrupt request goes out.</p>
<p>The <code>SC</code> bit indicates whether the write is setting bits (1) or
clearing them (0). Therefore, somewhat unintuitively, sending a 0 for
a bit does not clear that bit; it leaves it unaffected. To set bits,
one writes a value that has a 1 in the <code>SC</code> bit; i.e., writing 0x85
(10000101 )will set the <code>ALRM</code> and <code>TA</code> bits and leave the other bits
unaffected.</p>
<p>The same works for clearing bits, except that the <code>SC</code> bit is 0 in
that case. Similarly, writing 0x05 (00000101) will <em>clear</em> the <code>ALRM</code>
and <code>TA</code> bits and leave the others unchanged. This means that
clearing every bit actually requires writing something like 0x1F
(00011111, the values of bits 5 and 6 actually don't matter because
they're not associated with any interrupt flags).</p>
<p>Reading the ICR looks a little different.</p>

<p>Bits 0-4 are the same abbreviations as when writing the register. In
reading, however, they indicate that the event they're associated
with <em>has actually happened</em> since the last time the ICR was read.
The appropriate bit(s) will be set no matter what the interrupt mask
settings that have been written.</p>
<p>The masks instead affect the <code>IR</code> bit. If the event happened <em>and</em>
the ICR had been written with a value that turned the bit for that
event on, then the <code>IR</code> bit will also be set and the <code>_IRQ</code> pin will
go low.</p>
<p>Here is an example for illustration. The reset state of the 6526 has
all interrupt masks set to 0. If 0x82 (10000010) is written to the
register, then the Timer B mask will be turned on and all the others
will remain off. If Timer B was then set to count exactly two Timer A
underflows (<code>TBLO</code> is 0x02, <code>TBHI</code> is 0x00, and the <code>INMODE1</code> and
<code>INMODE0</code> bits of <code>CRB</code> are set to 10), then the first Timer A
underflow will only request an interrupt for Timer A and the second
will request for both.</p>
<p>In this scenario, when Timer A underflows for the first time, the
<code>_IRQ</code> pin will not be low and reading the ICR will yield 0x01
(00000001). The Timer A underflow has happened (hence the <code>TA</code> bit
being set when reading the ICR), but no interrupt has actually been
requested (the <code>IR</code> bit is 0 and the <code>_IRQ</code> pin is not low). This is
because the Timer A mask, set by writing the ICR, was never set to 1.</p>
<p>The <em>next</em> time Timer A underflows, it also causes a Timer B
underflow (since the latter was set to count 2 Timer A underflows).
This time, the <code>_IRQ</code> pin <em>will</em> go low, and reading the ICR will
produce 0x83 (10000011). The <code>TA</code> and <code>TB</code> bits are both set, and the
<code>IR</code> bit is also set, because the Timer B mask was set to 1 (the <code>TA</code>
bit is set because a Timer A event happened, but the Timer B event is
what actually set <code>IR</code>).</p>
<p>Reading the ICR will reset its value (just its read value; the masks
will remain the same) and reset the <code>_IRQ</code> pin.</p>
<h3>Control Register A (<code>CRA</code>)</h3>
<p>This control register handles Timer A, the serial port, and the
frequency of the TOD clock.</p>

<p>The <code>START</code> bit indicates whether Timer A is running. If it's at 0,
setting it to 1 is what starts the timer. If Timer Ais in one-shot
mode (see <code>RUNMODE</code> below), then when it underflows, this bit will be
automatically cleared.</p>
<p>The <code>PBON</code> bit can be set to 1 to have Timer A send output to pin
<code>PB6</code>. If this bit is 0 then <code>PB6</code> operates normally.</p>
<p>The <code>OUTMODE</code> bit says what kind of output <code>PB6</code> will have if it's
set to be the Timer A output with <code>PBON</code>. If this is 0, then <code>PB6</code>
will go high for one clock cycle when Timer A underflows. If it's 1,
then <code>PB6</code> will toggle between high and low each time Timer A
underflows.</p>
<p>The <code>RUNMODE</code> bit determines what happens to Timer A itself after it
underflows. A 0 here means continuous mode, where the timer will
reset and continue running. If it's 1, the timer will reset after
underflow but will stop (setting <code>START</code> to 0 in the process).</p>
<p>The <code>LOAD</code> bit is a strobe. It is not saved (on read, this bit will
always be 0, and writing a 0 to it has no effect). When <code>CRA</code> is
written with a 1 in this bit position, the contents of the shadow
register for each timer register will be immediately loaded into its
respective timer register. In this way, the timers can be reset
without having to wait for them to underflow (which is the only other
way that the contents of the registers are reset).</p>
<p>The <code>INMODE</code> bit determines what Timer A actually counts. If this is
0, Timer A counts pulses on the <code>φ2</code> pin (the system clock). If this
is 1, Timer A counts pulses on the <code>CNT</code> pin (which has no fixed
function; any external circuit can provide pulses for <code>CNT</code>).</p>
<p>The <code>SPMODE</code> bit determines whether the serial port is receiving (0)
or sending (1).</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>TODIN</code> bit sets the TOD clock frequency to 60Hz (0) or
50Hz (1). This does not, of course, change the actual clock frequency
on the <code>TOD</code> pin; this clock is supplied externally. It simply
changes how the TOD clock interprets those pulses. (In other words,
setting this to 50Hz while supplying a 60Hz external clock will make
for a TOD clock that runs very fast.)</p>
<h3>Control Register B (<code>CRB</code>)</h3>
<p>This control register handles Timer B and the setting of the TOD
registers.</p>

<p>The lower 5 bits of this register are identical to the lower 5 bits
of <code>CRA</code> except that they affect Timer B instead of timer A, and that
<code>PBON</code> sets the behavior of pin <code>PB7</code> rather than <code>PB6</code>.</p>
<p>In this register, <code>INMODE</code> takes two bits. This is because in
addition to the two events that Timer A can count, Timer B can count
two more.</p>
<ul>
<li>00: System clock (pin <code>φ2</code>) pulses</li>
<li>01: <code>CNT</code> pin pulses</li>
<li>10: Timer A underflows</li>
<li>11: Timer A underflows that happen when <code>CNT</code> is high</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ALARM</code> bit determines what a write to TOD registers actually
does. If this is 0, the TOD registers are written normally. If it's
1, then a write to the TOD registers is actually setting the TOD
alarm (held in unreadable shadow registers).</p>
<h2>Pin Interface</h2>
<p>Many of the pins have already been covered, but there's still a bit
more to talk about.</p>
<p>One important matter on pins that <em>have</em> been covered is that the
parallel port pins <code>PA0</code>-<code>PA7</code> and <code>PB0</code>-<code>PB7</code> are internally pulled
up. If nothing is connected to them or if no data is coming into an
input pin, that pin will read as a 1 when the <code>PRA</code> or <code>PRB</code>
registers are read.</p>
<p>Those registers are actually physically read and written through the
address pins <code>A0</code>-<code>A3</code> and the data pins <code>D0</code>-<code>D7</code>. The offset listed
in the very first table in this description is what must be on the
<code>A</code> pins, while the <code>D</code> pins either have the data to write to that
register or are set to the data to be read. Whether an operation is
to be a read or write is actually set by the <code>R__W</code> pin.</p>
<p><code>_RES</code> resets the chip when it's held low. Resetting makes all
registers go to 0 (which, as a side effect, sets all parallel port
pins to inputs, stops the timers, etc.) except for the interval timer
registers, which are all set to 0xFF.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an active low chip select pin <code>_CS</code>. Most of the
chip continues functioning (running down interval timers, keeping
track of the TOD, receiving data on ports, etc.) at all times. The
<code>_CS</code> simply must be low to do a read from or a write to the
registers.</p>
<p>The chip comes in a 40-pin dual in-line package with the following
pin assignments.</p>

<p>*(<code>Vss</code> and <code>Vcc</code> are ground and power supply pins respectively, and
they are not emulated.)</p>
<p>In the Commodore 64, U1 and U2 are both 6526's (called CIA1 and CIA2
respectively). CIA1 controls the keyboard and control (game) ports,
along with providing an interrupt (via its <code>_FLAG</code> pin) that fires
when the cassette is ready to be read. CIA2 controls the user port
and the serial port, along with the RESTORE key on the keyboard. It
also provides the upper two address pins to the VIC programmatically
via the kernal code. CIA2's interrupts are tied to the CPU's <code>_NMI</code>
pin rather than the regular <code>_IRQ</code> pin, so they will be handled
immediately.</p>

    <p>An emulation of the 74139 dual 2-to-4 demultiplexer.</p>
<p>The 74139 is one of the 7400-series TTL logic chips, consisting of a
paior of 2-input, 4-output demultiplexers. There are four possible
binary combinations on two pins (LL, HL, LH, and HH), and each of
these combinations selects a different one of the output pins to
activate. Each demultiplexer also has an enable pin.</p>
<p>Most literature names the pins with numbers first. This makes sense
since there are really two numbers that go into the output's name
(the demultiplexer number and the output number) and having a letter
separate them is quite readable. But since each of these pin names
becomes a property on the chip, that scheme cannot be used here.
Therefore each demultiplexer has two inputs starting with <code>A</code> and
<code>B</code>, an active-low enable pin starting with <code>_G</code>, and four inverted
outputs whose names start with <code>_Y</code>.</p>

<p>In the Commodore 64, the two demultiplexers are chained together by
connecting one of the outputs from demux 1 to the enable pin of demux
2. The inputs are the address lines <code>A8</code>-<code>A11</code>, and the enable pin of
demux 1 comes directly from the PLA's <code>_IO</code> output. Thus the
demultiplexers only do work when <code>_IO</code> is selected, which requires
that the address be from 0xD000 - 0xDFFF, among other things. A
more specific table for this setup can thus be created.</p>

<p>The decoding resolution is only 2 hexadecimal digits for the VIC,
SID, and color RAM and 3 hexadecimal digits for the CIAs and I/Os.
This means that there will be memory locations that repeat. For
example, the VIC only uses 64 addressable locations for its registers
(47 registers and 17 more unused addresses) but gets a 1024-address
block. The decoding can't tell the difference between 0xD000, 0xD040,
0xD080, and so on because it can only resolve the first two digits,
so using any of those addresses will access the VIC's first register,
meaning that it's mirrored 16 times. The same goes for the SID (29
registers and 3 usused addresses, mirrored in 1024 addresses 32
times) and the CIAs (16 registers mirrored in 256 addresses 16
times). The color RAM is not mirrored at all (though it does use only
1000 of its 1024 addresses) and the I/O blocks are free to be managed
by cartridges as they like.</p>

pin assignments.</p>

    <p>An emulation of the 74257 quad 2-to-1 multiplexer.</p>
<p>The 74257 is one of the 7400-series TTL logic chips, consisting of
four 2-to-1 multiplexers. Each multiplexer is essentially a switch
which uses a single, shared select signal to choose which of its two
inputs to reflect on its output. Each output is tri-state.</p>
<p>This chip is exactly the same as the <code><a href="global.html#Ic74258">Ic74258</a></code> except that
the latter has inverted outputs and this one doesn't.</p>
<p>The inputs to each multiplexer are the <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> pins, and the <code>Y</code>
pins are their outputs. The <code>SEL</code> pin selects between the <code>A</code> inputs
(when <code>SEL</code> is low) and the <code>B</code> inputs (when <code>SEL</code> is high). This
single pin selects the outputs for all four multiplexers
simultaneously. The active low output-enable pin, <code>_OE</code>, tri-states
all four outputs when it's set high.</p>

    <p>An emulation of the 74258 quad 2-to-1 multiplexer.</p>
<p>The 74258 is one of the 7400-series TTL logic chips, consisting of
four 2-to-1 multiplexers. Each multiplexer is essentially a switch
which uses a single, shared select signal to choose which of its two
inputs to reflect on its output. Each output is tri-state.</p>
<p>This chip is exactly the same as the <code><a href="global.html#Ic74257">Ic74257</a></code> except that
the this one has inverted outputs and the other doesn't.</p>
<p>The inputs to each multiplexer are the <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> pins, and the <code>_Y</code>
pins are their inverted outputs. The <code>SEL</code> pin selects between the
<code>A</code> inputs (when <code>SEL</code> is low) and the <code>B</code> inputs (when <code>SEL</code> is
high). This single pin selects the outputs for all four multiplexers
simultaneously. The active low output-enable pin, <code>_OE</code>, tri-states
all four outputs when it's set high.</p>

<p>In the Commodore 64, U14 is a 74LS258 (a lower-power, faster variant
whose emulation is the same). It's used to multiplex the upper two
lines of the multiplexed address bus from the <code>A6</code> and <code>A7</code> lines
from the 6567 VIC and the <code>_VA14</code> and <code>_VA15</code> lines
from one of the <a href="global.html#Ic6526">6526</a> CIAs.</p>
<p>This chip is produced by calling the
<code><a href="module-chips.html#.Ic74258">Ic74258</a></code> function.</p>

    <p>An emulation of the 74373 octal D-type transparent latch.</p>
<p>The 74373 is one of the 7400-series TTL logic chips, consisting of
eight transparent latches. These latches normally allow data to flow
freely from input to output, but when the latch enable pin <code>LE</code> is
set to low, the output is latched. That means it retains its current
state, no matter what the input pins do in the meantime. Once <code>LE</code>
goes high again, the outputs once more reflect their inputs.</p>
<p>Since this chip is most often used in bus-type applications, the pins
are named using more of a bus-type convention. The inputs are <code>D</code> and
the outputs are <code>Q</code>, and the latches are numbered from 0 rather than
from 1.</p>
<p>The chip has an active-low output enable pin, <code>_OE</code>. When this is
high, all outputs are set to a high impedance state.</p>

<p><em>(Q₀ means whatever level the pin was in the previous state. If the
pin was high, then it remains high. If it was low, it remains low.)</em></p>
<p>The chip comes in a 20-pin dual in-line package with the following
pin assignments.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-txt"><code>        +---+--+---+

<p><em>(<code>GND</code> and <code>Vcc</code> are ground and power supply pins respectively, and
they are not emulated.)</em></p>
<p>In the Commodore 64, U26 is a 74LS373 (a lower-power, faster variant
whose emulation is the same). It's used to connect the multiplexed
address bus to the lower 8 bits of the main address bus. It latches
the low 8 bits of the multiplexed bus so that, when the lines are
switched to the high 8 bits, those bits do not leak onto the low 8
bits of the main bus.</p>
<p>This chip is produced by calling the
<code><a href="module-chips.html#.Ic74373">Ic74373</a></code> function.</p>
