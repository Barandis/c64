<div class="description usertext">
    <p>An emulation of the 82S100 Programmable Logic Array, as it was
programmed for early Commodore 64's.</p>
<p>The 82S100 is a programmable logic chip made by Signetics and is
regarded as the very first programmable logic device, first released
in 1975. It took 16 inputs and could form up to 48 product terms
(P-terms) by logically ANDind and NOTing selections of the 16 inputs.
These P-terms were then fed to another array that would logically OR
them selectively, producing up to 8 sum terms (S-terms) that were
ultimately sent to the output pins (possibly after NOTing them
first). The programming for these P- and S-terms could be done in the
field in a similar manner to that of a PROM (programmable read-only
memory), and Commodore would program them as a part of production of
the C64.</p>
<p>A single 82S100 could therefore serve the same function as a large
number of 7400-series logic devices, for instance. It was used in a
vast array of machines, including other Commodore computers and disk
drives and those from several other companies. The differences
between the 82S100's used in each would be the programming of the
logic arrays.</p>
<p>CBM eventually created their own hard-coded versions of the 82S100,
which were faster and were cheaper for CBM to produce than it was for
them to buy and program 82S100's. The schematic from which this
emulation is being produced is an early one, from July, 1982, and at
that time the C64 was still using the Signetics device.</p>
<p>The input pins of the 82S100 were generically named I0-I15, and the
output pins were similarly named F0-F7. That has been maintained
here, though constants are provided to be able to use the more
C64-centric names that reflect the pins' actual functions in that
computer.</p>
<p>This chip was tasked with providing the chip enable signals for the
C64's RAM and color RAM; BASIC, kernal, and character ROM; registers
from the 6526 CIAs, 6567 VIC, and
6581 SID; and two banks of cartridge ROM and two banks
of cartridge I/O memory. The 6510 processor, having a 16-bit address
bus, could access 64k of memory, but all of this RAM and ROM together
added up to closer to 84k. Therefore the PLA used a combination of
inputs, including some of the address bus, the specialized 6510 I/O
port bus, and signals from the VIC and cartridge ROMs to determine
which memory was trying to be accessed at any given time, and then
provide chip enable signals for that memory (turning it on and
turning other memory that could be at the same address off). It would
do this for every memory access, which would happen twice per cycle
(half the cycle was used by the CPU, half by the VIC). Thus bank
switching actually happened at a frequency of 2MHz, twice the CPU
clock frequency, and the chip generated a fair bit of heat.</p>
<p>The purpose of the logic in the PLA is to take the current state of
the system during a memory access and produce a single output
enabling the one device (memory chip, processor chip with register,
cartridge, etc.) that will handle that memory access. (If the
selected output is _IO, that indicates that the I/O block of memory
is being accessed, but the PLA cannot determine <em>which</em> device is
being accessed from this information alone. When that happens, a
separate demultiplexer uses <code>A8</code>-<code>A11</code> to determine which device it
is.)</p>
<h3>Input pin assignments</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>I0</code>: <code>_CAS</code>,</strong> This is the control line from the VIC that
enables access to RAM. Instead of going directly to RAM, this
line comes to the PLA and if RAM access is selected, the _CASRAM
output is sent to the RAM chips.</li>
<li><strong><code>I1</code>: <code>_LORAM</code>.</strong> This line controls the memory block from 0xA000
<ul>
<li>0xBFFF. When high (normal), the BASIC ROM is available in this
memory block. When low, it's switched out for RAM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><code>I2</code>: <code>_HIRAM</code>.</strong> This line controls the memory area from
$E000...$FFFF. When high (normal), the KERNAL ROM is available in
this memory block. When low, it's switched out for RAM.</li>
<li><strong><code>I3</code>: <code>_CHAREN</code>.</strong> This line partially controls the memory block
from $D000...$DFFF. When high (normal), the I/O devices appear in
this memory block. When low, the character ROM appears here
instead. This line can be overridden by other signals, including
those allowing this memory block to contain RAM instead.</li>
<li><strong><code>I4</code>, <code>I14-I15</code>: <code>_VA14</code>, <code>VA13</code>, and <code>VA12</code>.</strong> When the VIC is
active, these are used to determine which block of memory the VIC
is trying to access. <code>_VA14</code> is active low because that's the way
it's generated by CIA2; it's inverted back into active high
before being used to access memory but not for use with the PLA.</li>
<li><strong><code>I5</code>-<code>I8</code>: <code>A15</code>-<code>A12</code>.</strong> Used to determine which block of memory
the CPU wishes to access while the CPU is active.</li>
<li><strong><code>I9</code>: <code>BA</code>.</strong> The VIC sets this &quot;Bus Available&quot; line high to
indicate normal bus operation, switching between VIC and CPU each
cycle. The VIC sets it low when it intends to take exclusive
access of the address bus.</li>
<li><strong><code>I10</code>: <code>_AEC</code>.</strong> This inverse of the VIC's &quot;Address Enable
Control&quot; signal indicates which of the CPU (low) or VIC (high) is
in control of the data bus.</li>
<li><strong><code>I11</code>: <code>R__W</code>.</strong> This is generally written <code>R/_W</code>, but the slash
is not a character that can be used in property names without
quoting it. A high signal means that memory is being read, while
a low means memory is being written. This makes a difference to
what memory is being accessed. For example, ROM cannot be
written; if an attempt is made to write to a ROM address while
ROM is banked in, the write will happen to RAM instead.</li>
<li><strong><code>I12</code>-<code>I13</code>: <code>_GAME</code> and <code>_EXROM</code>.</strong> These are used by cartridges
to indicate the presence of addressable memory within them. There
are two for-sure states for these two signals: if both are high
(the normal state), there is no cartridge; and if <code>_EXROM</code> is
high and <code>_GAME</code> is low, there is an Ultimax cartridge. Further
mapping to cartridge ROM depends not only on these two signals
but also on <code>_LORAM</code>, <code>_HIRAM</code>, and <code>_CHAREN</code>; <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Bank_Switching#Mode_Table">there is a nice
table here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output pin assignments</h3>
<p>Since the outputs are fed to chip select pins, which are universally
active low, all of these are programmed to be inverted. Thus, at last
seven of them will be high at any given time and at most one will be
low.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>F0</code>: <code>_CASRAM</code>.</strong> This is the signal that ultimately enables
RAM. The production of this signal is very different from the
others. For all other output, if one of their terms is selected,
that output will be selected. For <code>_CASRAM</code>, its terms are
combined with the terms from all other outputs (except for
<code>GR/_W</code>), and if any of the terms are selected, then <code>_CASRAM</code>
will be <em>de</em>selected. (Even if all of those other outputs are
deselected, <code>_CASRAM</code> will be deselected if <code>_CAS</code> is high or if
certain addresses are accessed while an Ultimax cartridge is
plugged in. In these cases, no PLA outputs will be selected.)</li>
<li><strong><code>F1</code>: <code>_BASIC</code>.</strong> Enables the BASIC ROM.</li>
<li><strong><code>F2</code>: <code>_KERNAL</code>.</strong> Enables the KERNAL ROM.</li>
<li><strong><code>F3</code>: <code>_CHAROM</code>.</strong> Enables the Character ROM.</li>
<li><strong><code>F4</code>: <code>GR__W</code>.</strong> (written <code>GR/_W</code> where slashes are legal.)
Indicates that the static color RAM is being written to. Note
that this is the only output that is not actually a chip enable
signal; color RAM is possibly enabled if the <code>_IO</code> output is
selected (see <code><a href="global.html#Ic74139">Ic74139</a></code> for details).</li>
<li><strong><code>F5</code>: <code>_IO</code>.</strong> Indicates that one of the following are going to
be enabled: CIA1 registers, CIA2 registers, VIC registers, SID
registers, color RAM, expansion port I/O from address 0xDE00 -
0xDEFF, or expansion port I/O from address 0xDF00 - 0xDFFF. Which
of these is actually enabled is done by decoding <code>A8</code>-<code>A11</code>,
which is done by the <a href="global.html#Ic74139">74139</a>.</li>
<li><strong><code>F6</code>: <code>_ROML</code>.</strong> Enables expansion port ROM from 0x8000 - 0x9FFF.</li>
<li><strong><code>F7</code>: <code>_ROMH</code>.</strong> Enables expansion port ROM from 0xE000 - 0xEFFF.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a ton of information about the internal workings of the
C64's version of the 82S100 in <a href="http://skoe.de/docs/c64-dissected/pla/c64_pla_dissected_a4ds.pdf">The C64 PLA Dissected</a>. This
document was used to derive all of the logic in this object and has a
number of interesting stories besides (if you find that sort of thing
interesting).</p>
<p>Additionally, the 82S100 has an active-low chip enable pin <code>_CE</code>
which is not used in the Commodore 64 (it is tied directly to ground
and therefore is always low, so the chip is always enabled). There is
also an <code>FE</code> pin that was used for programming the chip in the field;
the emulated chip from the C64 doesn't use this as the chip was
programmed during manufacturing.</p>
<p>The chip comes in a 28-pin dual in-line package with the following
pin assignments.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-txt"><code>        +-----+--+-----+
     FE |1    +--+   28| Vcc
     I7 |2           27| I8
     I6 |3           26| I9

     F5 |12          17| F1
     F4 |13          16| F2
    Vss |14          15| F3
        +--------------+
</code></pre>
<p><em>(<code>Vss</code> and <code>Vcc</code> are ground and power supply pins respectively, and
they are not emulated. <code>FE</code> is the field programming pin; this chip
was not programmed in the field for the Commodore 64, and it is not
emulated either.)</em></p>
<p>In the Commodore 64, U17 is an 82S100. As detailed extensively above,
it was used to decode signals to determine which chip would receive a
particular read or write.</p>
<p>This chip is produced by calling the
<code><a href="module-chips.html#.Ic82S100">Ic82S100</a></code> function.</p>

<div class="description usertext">
    <p>An emulation of the 2114 1k x 4 bit static RAM.</p>
<p>Static RAM differs from dynamic RAM (the RAM generally used for
computer memory) in that it doesn't require periodic refresh cycles
in order to retain data. Since no reads or writes have to wait for
these refresh cycles, static RAM is considerably faster than dynamic
RAM.</p>
<p>However, it's also considerably more expensive. For this reason,
static RAM is generally only in use in particularly speed-sensitive
applications and in relatively small amounts. For instance, modern
CPU on-board cache RAM is static. The Commodore 64 uses it for color
RAM, which is accessed by the VIC at a much higher speed than the
DRAM is accessed by the CPU.</p>
<p>The 2114 has 1024 addressable locations that hold 4 bits each. Since
the Commodore 64 has a fixed palette of 16 colors, 4 bits is all it
needs. Therefore a single 2114 could store 1k of colors and it isn't
necessary to use it with a second 2114 to store full 8-bit bytes.</p>
<p>The timing of reads and writes is particularly simple. If the chip
select pin <code>_CS</code> is low, the 4 bits stored at the location given on
its address pins is put onto the 4 data pins. If the write enable pin
<code>_WE</code> is also low, then the value on the 4 data pins is stored at the
location given on its address pins. The <code>_CS</code> pin can stay low for
several cycles of reads and writes; it does not require <code>_CS</code> to
return to high to start the next cycle.</p>
<p>The downside of this simple scheme is that care has to be taken to
avoid unwanted writes. Address changes should not take place while
both <code>_CS</code> and <code>_WE</code> are low; since address lines do not change
simultaneously, changing addresses while both pins are low can and
will cause data to be written to multiple addresses, potentially
overwriting legitimate data. This is naturally emulated here for the
same reason: the chip responds to address line changes, and those
changes do not happen simultaneously.</p>
<p>Aside from the active-low <code>_CS</code> and <code>_WE</code> pins, this simple memory
device only has the necessary address pins to address 1k of memory
and the four necessary bidirectional data pins. It's packages in an
18-pin dual-inline package with the following pin assignments.</p>

    <p>An emulation of the 2332 4k x 8-bit ROM.</p>
<p>This, along with the similar 2364, is far and away the simplest
memory chip in the Commodore 64. With its full complement of address
pins and full 8 data pins, there is no need to use multiple chips or
to multiplex addresses.</p>
<p>Timing of the read cycle (there is, of course, no write cycle in a
read-only memory chip) is done with a pair of active-low chip select
pins, <code>_CS1</code> and <code>_CS2</code>. When both are low, the chip reads its
address pins and makes the value at that location available on its
data pins. In the C64, <code>_CS2</code> is tied to ground, meaning <code>CS1</code> is the
only pin that needs to be manipulated.</p>
<p>The chip comes in a 24-pin dual in-line package with the following
pin assignments.</p>

    <p>An emulation of the 2364 8k x 8-bit ROM.</p>
<p>This, along with the similar 23632, is far and away the simplest
memory chip in the Commodore 64. With its full complement of address
pins and full 8 data pins, there is no need to use multiple chips or
to multiplex addresses.</p>
<p>Timing of the read cycle (there is, of course, no write cycle in a
read-only memory chip) is based solely on the chip select pin <code>_CS</code>.
When this pin goes low, the chip reads its address pins and makes the
value at that location available on its data pins.</p>
<p>The chip comes in a 24-pin dual in-line package with the following
pin assignments.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-txt"><code>        +-----+--+-----+

</code></pre>
<p><em>(<code>GND</code> and <code>Vcc</code> are ground and power supply pins respectively, and
they are not emulated.)</em></p>
<p>In the Commodore 64, U3 and U4 are both 2364A's (a variant with
slightly faster data access). U3 stores the BASIC interpreter and U4
stores the kernal.</p>

    <p>An emulation of the 4066 quad bilateral switch.</p>
<p>The 4066 is one of the 4000-series CMOS logic chips, consisting of
four symmetrical analong switches. The data pins transfer data
bidirectionally as long as their associated control pin is low. When
the control pin goes hish, no data can be passed through the switch.</p>
<p>When the control pin returns to low, both data pins return to the
level of the <em>last of them to be set</em>. This is a bit of a compromise
necessitated by the fact that this is a digital simulation of an
analog circuit, but it should be the most natural. Most use cases do
not involve switching the direction that data flows through the
switch regularly.</p>
<p>There is no high-impedance state for the pins of this device. When
the control pin his high, the data pins simply take on the level of
whatever circuits they're connected to. This is emulated by changing
their mode to <code>INPUT</code> so that they do
not send signals but can still track changes on their traces.</p>
<p>There is no consistency across datahsheets for naming the 4066's
pins. Many sheets simply have some data pins marked &quot;IN/OUT&quot; and
others marked &quot;OUT/IN&quot;, but those don't work well as property names.
For consistency with the rest of the logic chips in this module, the
data pins have been named <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, while thie control pin is
named <code>X</code>. The <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> pins are completely interchangeable and do
appear in different orders oon many datasheets; this particular
arrangement (if not the pin names) is taken from the datasheet for
the Texas Instruments CD4066B.</p>
<p>The chip comes in a 14-pin dual in-line package with the following
pin assignments.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-txt"><code>        +---+--+---+
     A1 |1  +--+ 14| Vdd
     B1 |2       13| X1
     B2 |3       12| X4
     A2 |4  4066 11| A4
     X2 |5       10| B4
     X3 |6        9| B3
    Vss |7        8| A3
        +----------+
</code></pre>
<p><em>(<code>Vdd</code> and <code>Vss</code> are power supply pins and are not emulated.)</em></p>
<p>This chip is unusual in that it's the only analog chip in the system
as emulated (with the exception of the filter portion of the
6581). Even so, it works fine for switching digital
signals as well, and one of the Commodore 64's two 4066's is in fact
used as a digital switch.</p>
<p>In the Commodore 64, U16 and U28 are 4066's. The former is used as a
digital switch to control which processor has access to the color
RAM's data pins, while the other is used as an analog switch to
control which game port is providing paddle data to the
6581 SID.</p>
<p>This chip is produced by calling the
<code><a href="module-chips.html#.Ic4066">Ic4066</a></code> function.</p>

<div class="description usertext">
    <p>An emulation of the 4164 64k x 1 bit dynamic RAM.</p>
<p>The 4164 is a basic DRAM chip that was used in a wide variety of home
computers in the 1980's: the Apple IIe, IIc, and 128k Macintosh; the
Atari 800XL; the Commodore 64 and 128; and the Radio Shack Color
Computer 2. Later editions of the Apple IIc, Commodore 64, Commodore
128, and COCO2 switched to the 4464.</p>
<p>This chip has a memory array of 65,536 bits, each associated with an
individual memory address. Therefore, to use a 4164 in an 8-bit
computer, 8 chips would be required to provide 64k of memory (128k
Macintosh and Commodore 128 would therefore use 16 of these chips).
Each chip was used for a single bit in the target address; bit 0
would be stored in the first 4164, bit 1 in the second 4164, and so
on.</p>
<p>Since the chip has only 8 address pins, an address has to be split
into two parts, representing a row and a column (presenting the
memory array as a physical 256-bit x 256-bit array). These row and
column addresses are provided to the chip sequentially; the row
address is put onto the address pins and  the active-low row address
strobe pin <code>_RAS</code> is set low, then the column address is put onto the
address pins and the active-low column address strobe pin <code>_CAS</code> is
set low.</p>
<p>The chip has three basic modes of operation, controlled by the
active-low write-enable (<code>_WE</code>) pin with some help from <code>_CAS</code>. If
<code>_WE</code> is high, then the chip is in read mode after the address is
set. If <code>_WE</code> is low, the mode depends on whether <code>_WE</code> went low
before the address was set by putting <code>_CAS</code> low; if <code>_CAS</code> went low
first, (meaning the chip was initially in read mode), setting <code>_WE</code>
low will start read-modify-write mode, where the value at that
address is still available on the data-out pin (<code>Q</code>) even as the new
value is set from the data-in pin (<code>D</code>). If <code>_WE</code> goes low before
<code>_CAS</code>, then read mode is never entered and write mode is enabled
instead. The value of <code>D</code> is still written to memory, but <code>Q</code> is
disconnected and no data is available there.</p>
<p>The Commodore 64 does not use read-modify-write mode. The <code>_WE</code> pin
is always set to its proper level before the <code>_CAS</code> pin goes low.</p>
<p>While <code>_WE</code> and <code>_CAS</code> control what is read from and/or written to
the chip's memory, <code>_RAS</code> is not needed for anything other than
setting the row address. Hence <code>_RAS</code> can remain low through multiple
memory accesses, as long as its address is valid for all of them,
allowing reads and writes to happen within a single 256-address page
of memory without incurring the cost of resetting the row address.</p>
<p>Unlike most other non-logic chips in the system, there is no
dedicated chip-select pin. The combination of <code>_RAS</code> and <code>_CAS</code> can
be regarded as such a pin, and it is used that way in the Commodore
64.</p>
<p>The chip comes in a 16-pin dual in-line package with the following
pin assignments.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-txt"><code>        +---+--+---+
     NC |1  +--+ 16| Vss

    <p>An emulation of the 74139 dual 2-to-4 demultiplexer.</p>
<p>The 74139 is one of the 7400-series TTL logic chips, consisting of a
paior of 2-input, 4-output demultiplexers. There are four possible
binary combinations on two pins (LL, HL, LH, and HH), and each of
these combinations selects a different one of the output pins to
activate. Each demultiplexer also has an enable pin.</p>
<p>Most literature names the pins with numbers first. This makes sense
since there are really two numbers that go into the output's name
(the demultiplexer number and the output number) and having a letter
separate them is quite readable. But since each of these pin names
becomes a property on the chip, that scheme cannot be used here.
Therefore each demultiplexer has two inputs starting with <code>A</code> and
<code>B</code>, an active-low enable pin starting with <code>_G</code>, and four inverted
outputs whose names start with <code>_Y</code>.</p>

<p>In the Commodore 64, the two demultiplexers are chained together by
connecting one of the outputs from demux 1 to the enable pin of demux
2. The inputs are the address lines <code>A8</code>-<code>A11</code>, and the enable pin of
demux 1 comes directly from the PLA's <code>_IO</code> output. Thus the
demultiplexers only do work when <code>_IO</code> is selected, which requires
that the address be from 0xD000 - 0xDFFF, among other things. A
more specific table for this setup can thus be created.</p>

<p>The decoding resolution is only 2 hexadecimal digits for the VIC,
SID, and color RAM and 3 hexadecimal digits for the CIAs and I/Os.
This means that there will be memory locations that repeat. For
example, the VIC only uses 64 addressable locations for its registers
(47 registers and 17 more unused addresses) but gets a 1024-address
block. The decoding can't tell the difference between 0xD000, 0xD040,
0xD080, and so on because it can only resolve the first two digits,
so using any of those addresses will access the VIC's first register,
meaning that it's mirrored 16 times. The same goes for the SID (29
registers and 3 usused addresses, mirrored in 1024 addresses 32
times) and the CIAs (16 registers mirrored in 256 addresses 16
times). The color RAM is not mirrored at all (though it does use only
1000 of its 1024 addresses) and the I/O blocks are free to be managed
by cartridges as they like.</p>

pin assignments.</p>

    <p>An emulation of the 74257 quad 2-to-1 multiplexer.</p>
<p>The 74257 is one of the 7400-series TTL logic chips, consisting of
four 2-to-1 multiplexers. Each multiplexer is essentially a switch
which uses a single, shared select signal to choose which of its two
inputs to reflect on its output. Each output is tri-state.</p>
<p>This chip is exactly the same as the <code><a href="global.html#Ic74258">Ic74258</a></code> except that
the latter has inverted outputs and this one doesn't.</p>
<p>The inputs to each multiplexer are the <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> pins, and the <code>Y</code>
pins are their outputs. The <code>SEL</code> pin selects between the <code>A</code> inputs
(when <code>SEL</code> is low) and the <code>B</code> inputs (when <code>SEL</code> is high). This
single pin selects the outputs for all four multiplexers
simultaneously. The active low output-enable pin, <code>_OE</code>, tri-states
all four outputs when it's set high.</p>

    <p>An emulation of the 74258 quad 2-to-1 multiplexer.</p>
<p>The 74258 is one of the 7400-series TTL logic chips, consisting of
four 2-to-1 multiplexers. Each multiplexer is essentially a switch
which uses a single, shared select signal to choose which of its two
inputs to reflect on its output. Each output is tri-state.</p>
<p>This chip is exactly the same as the <code><a href="global.html#Ic74257">Ic74257</a></code> except that
the this one has inverted outputs and the other doesn't.</p>
<p>The inputs to each multiplexer are the <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> pins, and the <code>_Y</code>
pins are their inverted outputs. The <code>SEL</code> pin selects between the
<code>A</code> inputs (when <code>SEL</code> is low) and the <code>B</code> inputs (when <code>SEL</code> is
high). This single pin selects the outputs for all four multiplexers
simultaneously. The active low output-enable pin, <code>_OE</code>, tri-states
all four outputs when it's set high.</p>

<p>In the Commodore 64, U14 is a 74LS258 (a lower-power, faster variant
whose emulation is the same). It's used to multiplex the upper two
lines of the multiplexed address bus from the <code>A6</code> and <code>A7</code> lines
from the 6567 VIC and the <code>_VA14</code> and <code>_VA15</code> lines
from one of the 6526 CIAs.</p>
<p>This chip is produced by calling the
<code><a href="module-chips.html#.Ic74258">Ic74258</a></code> function.</p>

    <p>An emulation of the 74373 octal D-type transparent latch.</p>
<p>The 74373 is one of the 7400-series TTL logic chips, consisting of
eight transparent latches. These latches normally allow data to flow
freely from input to output, but when the latch enable pin <code>LE</code> is
set to low, the output is latched. That means it retains its current
state, no matter what the input pins do in the meantime. Once <code>LE</code>
goes high again, the outputs once more reflect their inputs.</p>
<p>Since this chip is most often used in bus-type applications, the pins
are named using more of a bus-type convention. The inputs are <code>D</code> and
the outputs are <code>Q</code>, and the latches are numbered from 0 rather than
from 1.</p>
<p>The chip has an active-low output enable pin, <code>_OE</code>. When this is
high, all outputs are set to a high impedance state.</p>

<p><em>(Q₀ means whatever level the pin was in the previous state. If the
pin was high, then it remains high. If it was low, it remains low.)</em></p>

pin assignments.</p>

<p><em>(<code>GND</code> and <code>Vcc</code> are ground and power supply pins respectively, and
they are not emulated.)</em></p>
<p>In the Commodore 64, U26 is a 74LS373 (a lower-power, faster variant
whose emulation is the same). It's used to connect the multiplexed
address bus to the lower 8 bits of the main address bus. It latches
the low 8 bits of the multiplexed bus so that, when the lines are
switched to the high 8 bits, those bits do not leak onto the low 8
bits of the main bus.</p>
<p>This chip is produced by calling the
<code><a href="module-chips.html#.Ic74373">Ic74373</a></code> function.</p>
